# ospp-go-grpc

Go Plugin over gRPC is a lightweight Golang two-way communication plugin framework with built-in health check, plugin
management, logging and other extensions.

The framework is lightweight and very easy to use, you only need to spend a little time to migrate the existing plugin
implementation, or build your own plugin system from scratch.

For more details about the framework, please refer to the [examples](examples) directory.
